# Roadmap for Typography Package Workspace

This document outlines the roadmap for the Typography Package Workspace, detailing its current status, future plans, and key decisions made during development.

## Project Overview

The Typography Package Workspace provides a comprehensive solution for typography styling in web applications. It offers a minimal, self-contained CSS typography system with an optional React component wrapper. The package demonstrates best practices for CSS-in-JS integration, design token management, and multi-framework compatibility.

## Current Status

### What's Complete ‚úÖ

- **CSS Typography System**: Complete self-contained typography styles with CSS custom properties
- **React Component Wrapper**: Optional Typography component with polymorphic `as` prop support
- **Design Token Architecture**: Comprehensive CSS variable system for easy customization
- **Build System**: tsup configuration for ESM/CJS dual builds with CSS asset handling
- **Testing Framework**: Vitest with React Testing Library for component testing
- **TypeScript Support**: Full type definitions with polymorphic component interfaces
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Extensive variable system for theming and customization
- **Development Tooling**: Complete toolchain (ESLint, Prettier, TypeScript)
- **Example Applications**: Working examples with various frameworks (React, Vanilla JS)
- **Documentation System**: Comprehensive usage guides and integration examples
- **Dark Mode Support**: Built-in dark mode CSS variables
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first responsive typography system

### In Progress üöß

- **Typography Scale Optimization**: Fine-tuning modular scale and spacing ratios
- **Accessibility Enhancements**: WCAG compliance improvements and screen reader optimization

### Next Steps

- **Typography Presets**: Pre-built typography themes and configurations
- **Advanced Customization**: CSS-in-JS integration options and theme generators
- **Performance Optimization**: CSS optimization and critical path improvements

## Project Evolution

### Key Decisions Made

- **CSS-First Approach**: Pure CSS typography system with optional React wrapper
- **Design Token Architecture**: CSS custom properties for maximum flexibility
- **Polymorphic Component**: Single Typography component with `as` prop for element flexibility
- **Self-Contained System**: No external dependencies on styling frameworks
- **Modular Scale**: Mathematical typography scale for consistent proportions
- **Container Queries**: Modern CSS features for responsive typography

### Learnings and Insights

- **CSS Custom Properties**: Essential for creating flexible, themeable typography systems
- **Modular Scale**: Mathematical approach provides better visual hierarchy than arbitrary sizes
- **Polymorphic Components**: Single component with element flexibility reduces API complexity
- **CSS Asset Handling**: Build system needs special configuration for CSS file processing
- **Design Token Mapping**: CSS variables enable easy integration with existing design systems

### Recent Changes

- Migrated from standard-version to release-it for better GitHub integration
- Enhanced CSS custom properties system with comprehensive design tokens
- Improved responsive typography with container queries
- Added dark mode support with CSS variable overrides
- Implemented polymorphic component pattern for maximum flexibility
- Added comprehensive CSS documentation and customization examples
